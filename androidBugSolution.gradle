Ensure that your `build.gradle` files (both the project-level and module-level ones) specify an Android SDK version that is actually installed.

**Incorrect `build.gradle` (module-level):**
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33 // May not be installed
    // ... other configurations
}
```

**Corrected `build.gradle` (module-level):**
```gradle
android {
    compileSdkVersion 31 // Or a version that is installed
    // ... other configurations
}
```

**Also check your project-level `build.gradle` file for consistent SDK versions.**

After making changes to the `build.gradle` files, run `expo prebuild` and then try building again with `expo build:android`.  If necessary, clean your build cache (`expo prebuild --clean`).  You can also try syncing your project: `./gradlew clean` and `./gradlew assembleRelease`.
